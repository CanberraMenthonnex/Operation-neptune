# Components

This directory contains all the components used in the application. Each component is a separate file and is named according to the feature it is used in.

## Structure - Atomic Design

The components are organized using the atomic design methodology. This means that the components are organized into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. This allows for a more organized and scalable codebase.
Atoms are the smallest components, such as buttons, inputs, and labels. Molecules are made up of atoms and are used to create more complex components. Organisms are made up of molecules and are used to create even more complex components. Templates are made up of organisms and are used to create the layout of the page. Pages are made up of templates and are used to create the final page.
